== Gradle Enterprise 2014

Released 20th June 2017.

https://gradle.com/enterprise/releases/2017.4

== What is Gradle Enterprise?

== Build cache

Do more by building less.

== Build scans

Know thy build.

== You want to distinguish CI build scans from developer build scans

== You want source control information in your build scans

== You want to surface static code analysis issues in build scans

== Your build is failing with diagnostic output you don't understand

== Your configuration time is slower than it should be

== Your project fails to compile after updating your checkout

== Your project doesn't compile on your colleagues machine

== You want to make the build faster

== You want to make another build faster

== You’ve just started with build cache

== Your FROM-CACHE task is still a little slow

== You're getting an unexpected build cache miss

== Your build is slower for your colleague

== Some things we didn’t show

* Dependencies exploration and search
* Test failure pages
* Memory usage and garbage collection
* Searching with the scan list
* Leveraging your data with the Export API
* Exploring the plugins of your build
* Communicating build failures

== What's coming?

== Build scans

* More cross build analysis
* More resource usage insight
* Finer grained performance insight
* Developer oriented feedback
* …

== Build cache

* Cache federation / distribution
* Sophisticated cache topologies
* Transparent load balancing and fault tolerance
* Cache fetch cost/benefit analysis
* …

== Getting started

* Use scans.gradle.com
* Install a cache node
* Start a trial

== Gradle Enterprise 2014

Released 20th June 2017.
