== Gradle Enterprise 2014

Released 20th June 2017.

https://gradle.com/enterprise/releases/2017.4

== What is Gradle Enterprise?

== Build cache

Do more by building less.

== Build scans

Know thy build.

== Your build is emitting console output you don't understand

https://enterprise-demo.gradle.com/s/7ur7oyf4wocc2/log#L240[scan]

== Your configuration time is slower than it should be

https://enterprise-demo.gradle.com/s/ibm4hgyg4nwny/performance[scan]

== You want to distinguish CI build scans from developer build scans

== Build scan DSL

[source,groovy]
----
buildScan {
    if (System.getenv().containsKey("CI")) {
        tag "CI"
    } else {
        tag "local"
    }
}
----

https://enterprise-demo.gradle.com/s/nltdlvme6s726[local scan]

== You want source control information in your build scans

== Build scan DSL

[source,groovy]
----
def commitId = 'git rev-parse --verify HEAD'.execute().text.trim()
def status = 'git status --porcelain'.execute().text
buildScan {
    value "Git Commit ID", commitId
    link "Source", "https://github.com/company/project/tree/" + commitId

    if (status) {
        value "Git Status", status
        tag "dirty"
    }
}
----

== You want to surface static code analysis issues in build scans

== Build scan DSL

[source,groovy]
----
gradle.taskGraph.afterTask { Task task, TaskState state ->
    if (task instanceof Checkstyle && state.failure) {
        def checkstyle = new XmlSlurper().parse(task.reports.xml.destination)
        def errors = checkstyle.file.collect {
            String filePath = task.project.rootProject.relativePath(it.@name.text())
            it.error.collect { "${filePath}:${it.@line}:${it.@column} \u2192 ${it.@message}" }
        }.flatten()

        errors.each {
          buildScan.value 'Checkstyle Issue', it
        }
    }
}

== Your project fails to compile after updating your checkout

https://enterprise-demo.gradle.com/s/u4jphw7fqinka/log#L3[scan]

== Your project doesn't compile on your colleagues machine

TODO

== You want to make the build faster

https://enterprise-demo.gradle.com/s/36hkd5jqjnn2e[before]

https://enterprise-demo.gradle.com/s/dur7sgajrhjbu[after]

== You want to make another build faster

https://enterprise-demo.gradle.com/s/nnaix4qsxvwim[scan]

== You want to know why a task wasn't up-to-date

https://enterprise-demo.gradle.com/s/wzdgdzocd4cno[scan]

https://enterprise-demo.gradle.com/s/6dga4fmnosp5e/timeline?task=3scflzwkg4yxw[scan]

== How much build caching do I get?

https://enterprise-demo.gradle.com/s/v6sl5i657bvnc/performance/execution[scan]

== You're getting an unexpected build cache miss

TODO

== Some things we didn’t show

* Dependencies exploration and search
* Test failure pages
* Memory usage and garbage collection
* Searching with the scan list
* Leveraging your data with the Export API
* Exploring the plugins of your build
* Dependency download network activity
* …

== What's coming?

== Build scans

* More cross build analysis
* More resource usage insight
* Finer grained performance insight
* Developer oriented feedback
* …

== Build cache

* Cache federation / distribution
* Sophisticated cache topologies
* Transparent load balancing and fault tolerance
* Cache fetch cost/benefit analysis
* …

== Getting started

* Use scans.gradle.com
* Install a cache node
* Start a trial
